Efforts are underway to move evacuees by the hundreds to safety, including on a cruise ship that arrived Saturday morning in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nSearch and rescue personnel who arrived with cadaver dogs on the Abaco Islands brought body bags and coolers to store human remains, said Joy Jibrilu, director general of the country's tourism and aviation ministry.\n\n Workers also brought equipment to count the dead and to understand the scope of damage, Jibrilu said.\n\nThe smell of death lingered in the air in Marsh Harbour, CNN's Gary Tuchman reported Friday, as he toured hard-hit areas there\n\nTuchman accompanied U.S. Coast Guard and city of Miami paramedics as they conducted a grim search through rubble in Marsh Harbour Saturday. The crews found the body of a woman buried in the layers of rubble that now blanket the neighborhood.\n\nLocal firefighters told Tuchman they expect many more bodies will be found in the area.\n\nRavaged infrastructure has impeded search and recovery efforts, as the islands remain a mess of splintered buildings, torn-off roofs, snapped power poles and scattered vehicles.\n\nAt least 70,000 people are homeless on Abaco and Grand Bahama, the United Nations estimated early Saturday. A thousand tarpaulins -- strong pieces of waterproof plastic-- will be provided to replace roofs that were stripped from homes, the International Organization for Migration said.\n\nAbout 1,400 evacuees arrived Saturday morning in Palm Beach, Florida, aboard the Grand Celebration humanitarian cruise ship.\n\nPat Allard, 83, of Massachusetts said she went to the Bahamas before the storm to take care of her condo. She held back tears as she described the horrors of the hurricane.\n\n\"The roof caved in. The walls fell in. It was flooded. It was awful,\" she said, recounting that she moved to four different units in her condo building for safety. \"But I'm here. I made it.\"\n\nAll the evacuees are properly documented to enter the US, according to Customs and Border Protection. Spokesman Michael Silva said all 1,437 are either US citizens, US residents or non-US Citizens with visas, or had other proper documentation to enter the country.\n\nThe cruise line said it filled the ship with food, water, personal hygiene products, medical equipment, generators, volunteers, and first responders, and headed to the island to provide first aid.\n\nBy Friday, the Coast Guard also had rescued more than 230 people off the islands. Survivors packed their few remaining belongings and searched for a way out.\n\nAt Marsh Harbour, hundreds of people have lined up to take a ferry back to Nassau. The Royal Bahamian Defense Force Commander there told CNN he had enough food and water at the port and on the ship for everyone.\n\nPeople at the port had been waiting since the early morning hours, after hearing that there would be boats and they would be able to leave Saturday.\n\nMany recounted horrific stories of surviving the storm by breaking through rooftops or swimming onto boats to try and ride out the storm.\n\nSome reported that they had family members still missing, and that they witnessed friends and neighbors drown in the storm surge.\n\nTed Curry was one of more than 300 people waiting at the Leonard M. Thompson International Airport trying to get a flight to Nassau, the nation's capital, to stay with family. Hundreds more had grown tired of waiting and made their way to the island's main port.\n\n\"The island of Abaco has been through and survived many hurricanes in the past. It didn't take long for us to rebound, but this is different from anything we've ever experienced. This hurricane will set us back for years to come,\" he said.\n\n On Friday, Bahamas Air announced they had resumed service to Marsh Harbour in Abaco and Freeport in Grand Bahama, offering several relief flights between those areas and Nassau, according to Bahamas public broadcaster ZNS. \n\nThe airline issued a schedule of the flights on its Facebook page.  In the neighborhoods of the wrecked islands, evidence of the disaster is everywhere. \n\n \"When we were driving up, we could smell ... death,\" CNN's Patrick Oppmann said about Bevans Town on the island of Grand Bahama.\n\n The area is in ruins, he said. \"Every house, every structure, every life has been essentially destroyed in this area.\"\n\nEstimated death tolls have been \"harrowing and deeply distressing,\" said Jibrilu of the tourism and aviation ministry.\n\nThe public should prepare for \"unimaginable information about the death toll and the human suffering,\" Health Minister Duane Sands told Guardian Radio 96.9 FM.")

CEOs generally avoid controversial public issues lest disgruntled groups strike back. That's why Walmart's actions to limit ammunition sales and advocate for new gun safety legislation mark a significant milestone. CEO Doug McMillon's leadership heralds a new era of CEO courage in which the private sector takes responsibility for issues that elected officials are ducking.\n\nExercising courage isn't taking random action in response to a momentary crisis. Effectiveness requires a clear mission and strategy. Courage involves sacrifice for a greater good (e.g. being willing to take a short-term sales hit from the absence of a profitable item) in an effort to support social responsibility over the long term. CVS Health CEO Larry Merlo led the company to remove tobacco sales from its retail stores and offer smoking cessation products and services as part of a long-term transformation into a health care company.\n\nFor Walmart, no one knows how phasing out ammunition will affect its bottom line. Walmart is playing a longer game, apparently betting on more growth online and in suburban and urban areas. Loss of short-term sales could be offset by additional attention from Millennials, who say that they want their purchases to reflect their values, including sustainability and safe communities. McMillon's actions bring Walmart into greater alignment with this population. And employees, too, increasingly want to work at a place that reflects their values, pays them a fair wage and is safe.\n\nLeaders can't undertake significant change impulsively, addressing contentious issues with guns blazing (so to speak). Even when courageously addressing a big issue, they must keep the temperature down and the situation contained. Walmart's tone from the top has been respectful. McMillon stressed that he is a gun owner, implying that he understands the needs of gun rights advocates. He implied that Walmart is not \"anti\" anything; the company is \"for\" safety and preventing misunderstandings that produce tragedies. No ideology — just pragmatism about safety. Something that is legal and loved can still require caution: It's like parents who love football signing up their kids for soccer instead to reduce risk of concussions.\n\n Courage is not foolhardiness; it is a matter of deliberation and judgment. Courageous leaders want to see all the nuances in a situation so that they can keep risks in perspective before taking them. Walmart wisely took a month after the mass shooting in its El Paso store before announcing changes. Companies must know the limits of what they can do without jeopardizing other activities and people. It's often one small but well-chosen step at a time.\n\n Walmart's goal is to solve the wider national gun violence problem, not just protect its own territory. It takes courage to be among the first, but going first doesn't mean going it alone. Allies are critical to creating lasting change. Walmart's decision to ask customers in open carry states to not carry weapons openly in Walmart stores gave Kroger and CVS the impetus to do the same. McMillion also indicated willingness to work with the White House and Congress on legislation. Regardless of how powerful a giant corporation might be, it takes a cross-sector, multi-stakeholder coalition to tackle messy, recalcitrant problems.\n\nSome will say McMillon is not very courageous and not doing enough. After all, Walmart was already on this path by refusing to sell assault weapons, and the company will still sell hunting rifles. Others with an opposing view will call the actions cowardly — caving into temporary pressure from mass shootings.\n\nBut my experience with change on big issues shows that small steps can produce big impact. Now that the Business Roundtable has defined corporate purpose as encompassing social responsibility as well as shareholder value, Walmart's courage serves as an example for other CEOs, whether their concerns are guns, health or sustainability.")
    
    static let opinionPiece2 = NewsArticle(headline: "Pilot: Mechanic allegedly sabotages plane. How scary is that?", url: "https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/06/opinions/mechanic-sabotage-airplane-abend/index.html", authors: ["Les Abend"], newsOutlet: "CNN", lastUpdated: "7:45 PM ET, Fri September 6, 2019", text: "Before everyone goes all \"Die Hard 2\" and envisions airplanes being directed toward disaster by terrorist master minds, let's please pause to understand reality.\n\nI am referring to the July 17 event at Miami International Airport where it is alleged that an American Airlines 737 was sabotaged by an apparently disgruntled mechanic. The pilots determined there was a problem, discontinued the takeoff and safely returned the airplane to the gate, where it was then taken out of service for repair.\n\nIt appears that the mechanic tampered with an ADM (Air Data Module), which transmits important information, like airspeed, pressure, temperature and more to the cockpit instrument panel. Airliners are designed with redundant systems to act as back-up for failures, so this airplane had more than one ADM. More than likely, the crew either noticed a difference between their airspeed indications immediately or they received a display warning about the failure on their center cockpit display, or both.\n\nKudos to the pilots.\n\nEven if the airplane had become airborne, the pilots would have been able to safely return to the airport because they receive training for just such circumstances. In fact, as part of standard procedure, after accelerating to a speed of 80 knots (92 mph) pilots crosscheck their instrumentation for discrepancies during the takeoff roll.\n\nSo how did this happen? Airplane mechanics are licensed by the Federal Aviation Administration. To maintain their certification, they must undergo a rigorous training-- and recurrent training, as well. Airlines train mechanics for specific airplanes and for specific maintenance specialties. Whenever a mechanic repairs, replaces, or troubleshoots a problem, their signature and license number is recorded in a logbook. That signature is testimony to the airplane's airworthiness. It's a big deal.\n\nFor all my four-plus decades of flying airplanes, professionally and recreationally, I never doubted a mechanic's integrity. No mechanic would knowingly release an airplane for flight if they didn't believe that they could put their own family on board, or so I thought—and still, mostly, believe.Court documents say the mechanic in question here (who was identified using surveillance video ) told investigators that he was upset over a contract dispute between union workers and the airlines, and the dispute had cost him money, according to CNN reporting. He said he tampered with the aircraft so he could get overtime working on the plane.\n\nThis is of course ludicrous. Why a mechanic would deliberately sabotage an airplane and jeopardize not only the people on board, but his own livelihood is beyond my comprehension. Perhaps he believed that the warning systems would indicate a problem before the airplane left the gate.\n\nListen: Do mechanics, like other union employees, get frustrated at airline management because of stalled progress at the negotiation table? Of course. But normally the reaction is to nitpick, or to find mechanical discrepancies that don't affect the airworthiness of the plane, but enable the mechanic to keep the plane on the ground for a time. Repairing an item just prior to departure time creates delays, a circumstance that gets the attention of airline management.\n\nBut the flying public should be aware that mechanics are screened and scrutinized the same as any airline employee. Most folks that reach the airline level of employment have a resume and a proven track record of repairing airplanes. Security issues are rarely a problem. Mechanics are a tight-knit group, working the same shifts together. Unusual behavior doesn't go unnoticed.\n\nThis unfortunate situation is an anomaly. There is no epidemic of terrorist mechanics infiltrating the airlines. For this circumstance, the safeguards worked. The pilots followed their procedures. Airplane warning systems were activated as designed. The culprit was discovered. Bruce Willis did not have to intervene. You can now board your flight.")
